Hello, I am attempting to rewrite Rust tutorials mostly for my own use. Regurgitating information in a modified way helps me retain information.

First and foremost, I am going to avoid duplicating things that are overly boring to me and I will be brief with regularly boring stuff. For example, I will briefly introduce `cargo` the package and build manager. I will not talk about things that aren't essential for the fundamental use of the tool; leaving that for other, more detailed, dare I say *better* tutorials.

The commands will be run in a unix-style command line but should be fairly easy to translate if you like Windows. ``¯\_(ツ)_/¯``
