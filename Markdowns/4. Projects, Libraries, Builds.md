## Projects
If you want to do much with rust, you will need to install libraries. If you want to install libraries, your best bet is to do it within a *project*, which is done with the multi-tool project manager `cargo`.

Create a project with `$ cargo new name_of_project` which will create a subfolder with the name of the project.

## Libraries

If you are familiar with Python, you are familiar with `pip`, which is a reasonable facsimile of the package manager element of `cargo`.

Rust calls these packages `crates` or `library crates` which pair nicely with the name `cargo`. 

Within your new project folder is a file called `Cargo.toml` which handles, among other things, the dependencies for your project. If you wanted to include the package `rand` for example, you would open the file, navigate to the `[dependencies]` section and add a line that like this:
```
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

At the time of writing, `rand 0.8.5` is the latest version of this project, but you can specify any valid version using *semantic versioning*.

## Build Manager
`cargo` also handles builds, which probably won't be familiar to someone who has just lived in python. 

`cargo build` will... you know, build the project.
